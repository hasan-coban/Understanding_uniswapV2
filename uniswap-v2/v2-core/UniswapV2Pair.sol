/* What is libraries/UQ112x112 ? 

 * Solidity doesn't support floating point numbers so uniswap uses binary point format to encode and manipulate data

 * And if you're wondering why solidity doesn't support floating point numbers then open your browser console and calculate
`0.1 + 0.2`.
   This will eventually cause rounding errors

 * UQ112x112 means 112 bits uses for left of the decimal(the whole part of number) and 112 uses for right of the decimal(the fractional part), 
which is total 224 bits.   224 leaves 32 bits from 256 bits(which is max capacity of a storage slot)

 * Price could fit in 224 bits but accumulation not. The extra 32 bits is for price accumulation.

 * Reserves are also using this format, so both reserves can fit in 224 bits and 32 bits is lefts for timestamp.

 * Timestamp could be bigger than 32 bits that's why they mod it by 2**32, so it can fit in 32 bits even after 100 years.
(check `_update` function)

 * They are saving 3 variables (reserve0 + reserve1 + blockTimestampLast) in a single storage slot for saving gas
as we know storage is so expensive
